This book is my attempt to form a theory on how to live life.
First, I present what we generally want out of life, then the rest of the book
describes how to maximize that. I also consider topics like morality
and compassion in the context of this theory.

\chapter{What We Live For}
\begin{axiom}
	We live to maximize $\int_{birth}^{death} happiness \, dt$
\end{axiom}

Let's call happiness the $h$ function. It has some properties:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Happiness is transient and changes with time $\rightarrow$ it's
	a function of time $h(t)$
	\item We can only be so happy (or sad) at any time $\rightarrow h(t)$ is bounded
	\item Sometimes we feel life is not worth living $\rightarrow$ let this be when $h(t) < 0$
\end{enumerate}  

This axiom is motivated by asking what the meaning of life is.
There's no satisfactory answer because we can always ask why.
Being happy seems to be the most common and the one that
other answers can be broken down to.
